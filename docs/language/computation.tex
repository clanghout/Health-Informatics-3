To perform a computation on a table and save the result we support the computation analysis. For example: \\
$def\ comp : Computation = NAME\ relativeDates\ NEW\ SET\ COLUMNS\ RELATIVE(\#1995-01-17\#, TO\_DATE(admire2.date), DAYS)\ AS\ date; \\
from(admire2)|computation(comp);$
Results in a new table being called relativeDates containing a single column called date in which there is a integer which is the number of days between my birthday and the given measurement.

The computation has the following syntax: \\
$def Identifier : MacroType = NAME\ Identifier\ \\
(NEW|INCLUDE\ EXISTING)\ \\
SET\ COLUMNS\ (Expression\ AS\ Identifier,)+;$

If INCLUDE EXISTING is used instead of NEW, the columns of the original table are included in the result. As shown you can include multiple columns by separating them with a comma.
