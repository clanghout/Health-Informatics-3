We should support basic operations such as $+, -, *, /, pow(), sqrt()$.

For time operations we have the ADD and MIN operation to add or subtract time. An example would be $table.date MIN \#1 DAYS\#$, which does exactly what you'd expect.

We also support the RELATIVE operation. This calculates the differences between 2 dates in the given unit. So $RELATIVE(\#1995-01-17\#, \#1995-01-18\#, DAYS)$ results in 1. Since this is an integer, you can then apply the other computations to it.
