Comparisons allow you to compare 2 tables. For example:

$def\ comp : Comparison = admire2\ WITH\ filtered\ AS\ compared \\
ON\ admire2.date\ TO\ filtered.Date; \\
compare(comp)$

The syntax is:
$
def\ Identifier : Comparison = Identifier\ WITH\ Identifier\ AS Identifier\ \\
ON\ ColumnIdentifier\ TO\ ColumnIdentifier;$ \\

There is also a time between process which calculates the time between the rows of a table. For example:
$from(admire2)|timeBetween(date)$
