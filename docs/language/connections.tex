The first means that we only connect one row to another. The results and triggered by are to be used when checking if there are any connections. The 

This results in something like this: \\
$
def\ measurementInput(measurement, input) : Connection = FIRST\ input\ WHERE\ input.time < measurement.time\ AND\ input.date >= measurement.date\ ORDER\ input.date, input.time\ ASC
$ \\\\
$
connection(measurementInput, statSensor, website)|is(connected)
