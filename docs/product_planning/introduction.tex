\section{Introduction}
When patient has had a kidney transplant, he has to visit the hospital regularly. This is very unpleasant for the patient. Therefore there has been a research, where the patient had to monitor himself instead of going to the hospital \cite{Admire} \cite{Admire2}. During the research researchers collected data. Now the data must be analyzed.\\
We have to create a standalone application that is able to analyze the behavior of the patients. The application must analyze the data for certain events or patterns. Furthermore the results of the analysis must be stored in such way that further statistical analysis is possible. Finally the researchers wants to be able to explore the data by making use of data visualization. \\
The analysis of the data will be done by making use of Exploratory Sequential Data analysis techniques\cite{esda}.
