\subsection{High-level product backlog}
\label{subsec: MoSCoW}
In this section we describe the product backlog according the MoSCoW method. Therefore the features are divided into four group. The features are divided based on their priority. Section \ref{subsec: release-plan} describes for some features a user story.
\subsubsection{Must Haves}
These features are essential for the product. Without these features the product is not usable.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Language in which the user can describe different analyses
  \item Executing an analysis that is defined in a file.
  \item Load data in the program based on a description file.
  \item Indicating the data connections between the different datafiles
  \item Indicating the meaning of the various data inputs
  \item Load data from different sources using the one data description file
  \item The 8 C's for exploratory data analysis
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Chunk analysis
    \item Comments
    \item Codes 
    \item Connections
    \item Comparisons
    \item Constraints
    \item Conversions
    \item Computations
  \end{itemize}
  \item Specifying the output and output format
  \item Visualizations from the analyzed data
  \begin{itemize}
  	\item Frequency bars
    \item Line graph
  \end{itemize}
  \item Manual for the analysis description language
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Should Haves}
These features are very useful. However without these features the product is still usable.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Visualizations
    \begin{itemize}
    	\item Box plot
        \item Stem leaf
        \item State transition matrix
        \item Lag analysis
    \end{itemize}
	\item Exporting the visualizations to images
    \item Implement some example analyses in our analysis description language
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Could Haves}
These features will only be done when there is enough time.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item Visualizations
  \begin{itemize}
	  \item Histogram
      \item Markov chain
      \item Transition diagram
  \end{itemize}
  \item Editor for inputting an analysis description 
  \item Mass input for batch processing 
  \item Preview of the output from the analyses
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Would Haves}
These features will not be implemented during this project. If this project is followed up by another project, these feature might be interesting.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Easy to use GUI for specifying the analyses 
\end{itemize}
