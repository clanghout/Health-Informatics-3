\subsection{Initial release plan}
\label{subsec: release-plan}
This section will describe the planning for the product. The release plan is based on sprints of one week and on the roadmap described in section \ref{subsec: roadmap}. The numbers of the week correspond to the week of quarter 4. A new iteration starts on every Friday. For each week we will list which features the product should have and which additional task must be done. Furthermore for each feature we will list the priority. This is the same priority as in section \ref{subsec: MoSCoW}.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Setup the software that is used during the project
	\item Obtain the requirements
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item A basic architecture for the product
\item A design for the user interface
\item A draft version of the product vision
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.3}
\begin{itemize}
	\item A minimal user interface according the design of week 4.2
	\item The final version of the product vision
	\item A draft version of the product planning

	\item The user must be able to specify which data must be written to a file (Must Have)
	\item The user must be able to perform constraint analyses (Must Have)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.4}

	\item The user must be able to perform chunking analyses (Must Have)
	\item The user must be able to perform connections analyses (Must Have)
	\item The user must be able to perform computation analyses (Must Have)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.5}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The user must be able to perform codes analyses (Must Have)
	\item The user must be able to perform comparisons analyses (Must Have)
	\item It must be possible to show the data as frequency bars (Must Have)

	\item The user must be able to perform comments analyses (Must Have)
	\item The user must be able to perform conversions analyses (Must Have)
	\item It must be possible to show the data as a box plot (Should Have)
	\item It must be possible to show the data as a Stem-and-Leaf plot (Should Have)
	\item Input for SIG
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.7}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It must be possible to show the data as a state transition matrix (Should Have)
	\item Show the data with Lag analysis (Should Have)
	\item The user must be able to export the visualizations as an image (Should Have)
	\item It must be possible to show the data as a Histogram (Could Have)

	\item It must be possible to show the data as a Markov chain (Could Have)
	\item Specify multiple files that all will be analyzed individually (Could Have)
	\item Implement certain analyses functions in our language (Should Have)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.9}
	This is the last week where it is possible to work on the code. No new features are planned for this week. In this way we will be able to handle some delay during the process. Furthermore this week is used to repair the last bugs. Therefore there is a feature freeze on Wednesday June 17. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Final input for SIG
	\item Draft version of the final report
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Week 4.10}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Final report
	\item Product presentation
