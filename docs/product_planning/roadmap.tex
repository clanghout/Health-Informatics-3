\subsection{Roadmap}
\label{subsec: roadmap}
This section will describe the planning for the product. In this roadmap we will plan the mayor releases. For a detailed overview of the task for each week see section \ref{subsec: release-plan}. The numbers of the week correspond to the week of quarter 4. A week ends on Friday.\\
Week 5 and 7 does not have a specific release goal, in those week we should work on the goals for the next week. The goals of week 6 and 8 are too large to achieve in one week. Thus week 5 and 7 should be used to achieve those goals.\\\\
