What have we done this project? How did we achieve to get where we are? In this report we will show you how, what, and why we have done what we have done.

We will start with a software overview, which will show the functionalities which have been implemented. A reflection on the software engineering will follow this, to explain how we went to work, what code requirements our group had set, how we handled feedback and more. To fully explain and describe the functionalities of the software, a feature description comes after the reflection, where all functionality aspects will come to discussion. After explaining the features a description will be given about how we managed to design and create our software to meet requirements which have been taught to us in the interaction design course. This will be followed by a product evaluation chapter to discuss the product in its entirety and last but not least we will give you an outlook on the future of our system.
