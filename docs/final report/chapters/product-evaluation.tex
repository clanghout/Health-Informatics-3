\section{Product}
Even though our product has many features, it can be reduced to 4 simple modules:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Data Importation Module
	\item The Data Viewing Module
	\item The Analysis Module
	\item The Visualization Module
\end{itemize}
These are the same modules that'd been mentioned in the first context specific lecture, so in general we got the basics down. For our features we focussed mostly of the must haves in the requirements. These were roughly specified in the first lectures and after a couple of weeks we got the actual product requirements.

As mentioned in the engineering reflection we'd hoped to finish the must haves early and perhaps tackle a couple of could haves. However due to some issues we encountered we had to adjust our planning to finish all the must haves. This meant that some features we were hoping to get in didn't make the cut.

Overall we must say that it is really hard to anticipate exactly how the final product will turn out. You have an idea of which features you should provide, but the way all those features work together is something else entirely. In the end were satisfied with the result and how everything turned out. We missed the time to really polish it up and get all the bugs out of there, but it is a program which does what it is supposed to and it can do a whole lot more.

\section{Modules}


Explain the functional modules (importing analyzing visualizing and exporting (short recap of chapter 4))

\section{Failure Analysis}
Talk about the failures in our system. (problems with types (defining abstract methods for float and int) problems with visualisations and importing)
